**`Software Engineer at Lockheed Martin `**

I'm a Software Engineer with a B.S. in Computer Science from Cal Poly Pomona with a passion for Software Development, Robotics, and Machine Learning/AI. In my free time I enjoy doing robotics projects honing my skills in 3d Modeling/Printing, hardware (pc components, microcontrollers, and motors), and various programming languages. My preferred languages are Java, C++, C#, and Python.
