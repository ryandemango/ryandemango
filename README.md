**`Software Developer`**

I'm a Computer Science student at Cal Poly Pomona graduating in May 2023, aspiring to work in Software Development, Robotics, and Machine Learning/AI. In my free time I enjoy doing projects more akin to Robotics which have honed my skills in 3d Modeling/Printing, hardware (pc components, microcontrollers, and motors), and various programming languages. My preferred languages are Java, C#, SQL, and Python.
